    <h1>Functional Testing</h1>
    <p>Functional testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying that a software application's functions and features work correctly as per the defined specifications. It aims to ensure that the software performs its intended tasks and operations without errors. Here are some key aspects of functional testing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testing Functionality:</strong> Functional testing verifies that the software's functions, such as data processing, user interfaces, calculations, and integrations, work as expected.</li>
        <li><strong>Requirements Validation:</strong> It ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and adheres to the documented functional specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive and Negative Testing:</strong> Test cases cover both expected, positive scenarios and potential error conditions, helping to identify defects and vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Black-box Testing:</strong> Testers typically perform functional testing without knowledge of the internal code, focusing on inputs, outputs, and system behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Functional tests are often included in regression testing to verify that new features or changes do not break existing functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interaction:</strong> It assesses how users interact with the software and whether it provides a seamless and user-friendly experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functional testing is an essential part of software quality assurance and ensures that the software product delivers the expected functionality and meets user needs and business objectives.</p>
