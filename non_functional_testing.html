    <h1>Non-Functional Testing</h1>
    <p>Non-functional testing, also known as quality assurance testing, focuses on the attributes and characteristics of a software system that are not directly related to its functionality but are crucial for assessing its overall quality. This type of testing is concerned with the non-functional aspects of the software. Here are some key aspects of non-functional testing:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Testing:</strong> This category includes tests like load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing, which assess how the software performs under different conditions and levels of stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Security testing examines the software for vulnerabilities, ensuring that it is protected against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Usability testing assesses how user-friendly the software is and whether it provides a satisfying user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility Testing:</strong> This testing checks whether the software functions correctly on various devices, browsers, and operating systems, ensuring compatibility with different environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability Testing:</strong> Reliability testing evaluates the software's stability and consistency under various conditions and over an extended period.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability Testing:</strong> Scalability testing determines how well the software can handle increased workload and data volume as user numbers grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability Testing:</strong> Availability testing ensures that the software is accessible and reliable whenever it is needed, without excessive downtime.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Non-functional testing is crucial for assessing the overall quality, performance, and user experience of a software application. It helps to identify and address issues related to security, performance, and usability, ensuring that the software meets the expectations of both users and stakeholders.</p>
