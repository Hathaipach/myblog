    <h1>Requirement Analysis</h1>
    <p>Requirement analysis is a crucial phase in the software development process that involves gathering, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders. It serves as the foundation for designing and building a software system that meets these requirements. Here are key aspects of requirement analysis:</p>

    <h2>Stakeholder Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Effective requirement analysis involves collaboration with various stakeholders, including clients, users, business analysts, and subject matter experts. Key activities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> Conducting interviews to elicit and clarify requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Requirement Workshops:</strong> Organizing workshops to gather requirements and foster communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Gathering:</strong> Seeking feedback and input from stakeholders throughout the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirement Elicitation</h2>
    <p>Eliciting requirements involves techniques for extracting and capturing the needs of stakeholders. Common methods include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Distributing surveys to collect structured information from a large group of users or clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Observations:</strong> Observing users in their natural environment to understand their work processes and needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Creating prototypes or mock-ups to visualize and validate requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Requirement Documentation</h2>
    <p>Clear and detailed documentation is essential for recording and communicating requirements. Documents may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirements Specifications:</strong> Detailed documents describing functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Diagrams and narratives that depict how users will interact with the software.</li>
        <li><strong>User Stories:</strong> Short, user-focused descriptions of specific software features or functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validation and Verification</h2>
    <p>Validating and verifying requirements ensures that they are complete, accurate, and aligned with stakeholder needs. Techniques include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Review and Feedback:</strong> Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to identify inconsistencies and gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Building prototypes to validate and refine requirements with user feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Establishing traceability to link requirements to design and test cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Effective requirement analysis is fundamental to successful software development, as it sets the stage for designing, building, and testing a system that meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.</p>
