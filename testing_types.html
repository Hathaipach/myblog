    <h1>Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and System Testing</h1>
    <p>Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing are essential components of the software testing process, each serving a distinct purpose in ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems. Here's an overview of each type of testing:</p>

    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
    <p>Unit testing is the practice of testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation. These units can be functions, methods, or small modules. The key aspects of unit testing include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Each unit is tested in isolation, meaning that dependencies on other components are replaced with test doubles (e.g., mocks or stubs).</li>
        <li><strong>Code Coverage:</strong> Unit tests aim to achieve high code coverage by testing various execution paths within a single unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Early Detection of Bugs:</strong> Unit testing helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, making it cost-effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Unit tests are typically automated and included in the development process for continuous regression testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
    <p>Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions and interfaces between different units or components of a software application. It ensures that these units work together as intended. Key aspects of integration testing include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interaction Testing:</strong> Testing the communication and data exchange between various units to detect integration issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Ensuring that dependencies between components are handled correctly and that data flows smoothly between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenarios and Data Flows:</strong> Testing real-world scenarios and data flows to ensure proper integration of components.</li>
        <li><strong>Interface Testing:</strong> Validating that the interfaces between units, services, or modules are well-defined and function as expected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Testing</h2>
    <p>System testing assesses the entire software application as a complete system, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements and functions properly in its target environment. Key aspects of system testing include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Testing:</strong> Testing the application's end-to-end functionality and user scenarios to simulate real-world usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment Environment:</strong> Verifying that the software operates correctly in the target deployment environment (e.g., production-like settings).</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability and Performance:</strong> Evaluating the software's performance, scalability, and reliability under various conditions and workloads.</li>
        <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Assessing the user experience and ensuring that the software is user-friendly and accessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unit testing, integration testing, and system testing together provide a comprehensive approach to validating software quality, from individual components to the entire system, helping to identify and address issues at different stages of the development process.</p>
