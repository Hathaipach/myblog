    <h1>White Box vs. Black Box Testing</h1>
    <p>White box testing and black box testing are two different approaches to software testing, each with its own focus and objectives. Here's a comparison between these two testing methods:</p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>White Box Testing</th>
            <th>Black Box Testing</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Knowledge of Internal Structure</td>
            <td>Testers have knowledge of the internal structure and code of the software being tested.</td>
            <td>Testers do not have knowledge of the internal structure or code and focus on the software's external behavior.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test Focus</td>
            <td>Focuses on code-level testing, logic, and internal program paths.</td>
            <td>Focuses on testing the software's functionality and behavior without considering the internal implementation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Types of Testing</td>
            <td>Includes unit testing, code coverage testing, and structural testing.</td>
            <td>Includes functional testing, usability testing, security testing, and performance testing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Test Case Design</td>
            <td>Test cases are designed based on the internal code and logic, often using code coverage metrics.</td>
            <td>Test cases are designed based on specifications, requirements, and user scenarios.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Testers' Role</td>
            <td>Testers are usually developers or testers with knowledge of the internal code.</td>
            <td>Testers can be non-developers, focusing on testing from a user's perspective.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>White box testing and black box testing serve different purposes in the software testing process, and both approaches are valuable for ensuring software quality and reliability.</p>
